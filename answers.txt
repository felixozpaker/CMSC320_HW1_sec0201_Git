Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git helps keep track of changes in code/files over time. 
It also allows for more scalable work, as it allows multiple people 
to collaborate on the same project/codebase without overwriting eachothers work. 
It also makes it easy to add features via creating new branches and merging them, 
reverting to previous versions, and view, deploy, and share projects via GitHub.
