Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git helps keep track of changes in code/files over time. 
It also allows for more scalable work, as it allows multiple people 
to collaborate on the same project/codebase without overwriting eachothers work. 
It also makes it easy to add features via creating new branches and merging them, 
reverting to previous versions, and view, deploy, and share projects via GitHub.


Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to multiple fields, one of which being sports.
In sports, data science can be used to analyze player performance, injury data, and movement
patterns during games/training. These can help teams make better decisions in strategy, injury 
prevention, and player management/selection, ultimately giving teams an edge and preventing
injury.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: The difference between merging and rebasing is that merging creates a new merge commit
that combines two branches while preserving the existing commit history. On the other hand 
rebasing rewrites the feature branches commits by reapplying them on top of the main branch.
